# Hydra DEX

For now here is an ordinal centralized exchange (EX), ready to 80%. But the primarily goal is to create
the first decentralized exchange (DEX). The DEX is 15% ready.

The basic market advantage of Hydra is fully open source and decentralization. No license
to code or idea. No one human is the owner or author of code or project. It means that nobody able
to close the project or stop it by scam or concessions to government. 

This is why the name of project is Hydra. There will not be the main head, every private person can become
an another one head of project, just installing the node to server or committing some code. Or even by
creation of independent fork (all forks are welcome).
